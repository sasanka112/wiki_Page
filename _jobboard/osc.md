topic_description:   Online Solution Configurator
topic_more_description: Online Solution Configurator ( Previously known has Dell Star )  is an online application used to configure DataCenter orders and other types of Solution Orders. Primarily Solution orders are those where Dell is offering e2e solution from Hardware, software, data management, storage and setup of datacenters etc. OSC orders even though they are split and fulfilled, they need to be assembled back in the logistics and  shipped in the groups. OCI has a service to pull the Solution attributes from OSC and update it to OMEGA. These attributes are needed by EBI.  OCI also has a service callout to SDR to generate the agreement ID based on which entitlements are created for the solution orders.
